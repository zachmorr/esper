# Esper Software

## Installation

### Arduino

At the moment there is no support for the Arduino environment yet, but it is something that is being worked on.

### Requirements

In order to build and flash Esper, you will first need to [install ESP-IDF](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/#installation-step-by-step) then [set up the environment variables](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/index.html#step-4-set-up-the-environment-variables).


### Configuration

If you are not using the Esper hardware, you will need to configure the project for your device. To do this, run 

    cd esper/software/firmware
    idf.py menuconfig

Then configure the options under Application Configuration to match your device's capabilities.

### Building & Flashing

After installing ESP-IDF, build and flash your device by running these commands.

    cd esper/software/firmware
    idf.py build
    idf.py -p PORT [-b BAUD] flash

### Monitoring

If logging is enabled in your build, you can monitor the device while it is connected to your PC with this command

    idf.py -p PORT monitor

### Issues

If you have any issues, [this section](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/index.html#encountered-issues-while-flashing) may be able to help.

### Website & Blacklist

If any changes are made to the website or blacklist in their respective directories, you will have to run the reformat scripts in the Scripts folder in order for the changes to be put into the build.
Examples of running the scripts can be seen in the build.sh script
