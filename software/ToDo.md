## Maybe Some Day:
- DHCP support
    - Individual block lists for devices
    - User accounts??
- DNS Over HTTPS (early tests dont look hopeful for ESP32, will likely need MPU)

## Known Bugs:
- Logging breaks under high bandwidth (~25 queries per second)
- Throws "emac_esp32: no mem for receive buffer" at high bandwidth 
- Does not respond to queries with 'Additional Sections' (aka dig) correctly
- Does not repond to reverse lookups correctly
- Have to reset device if network ssid/pass change
- black/whitelist buttons on homepage do not update after being added
